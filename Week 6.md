# Development Activity: Build a Simple Portfolio Page

## Overview

In this activity, you'll create a simple web-based portfolio to organize and reflect on some of the work you've done in this course. This will help you practice basic front-end development and begin shaping a collection of your design and development efforts.

## Objective

- Use HTML and CSS to build a structured web page  
- Organize your own course artifacts into a simple layout  
- Reflect on how each piece demonstrates a skill or concept

## Instructions

1. Create a new HTML file named `portfolio.html`.

2. Structure your portfolio page with the following sections:

   - **Header:** Your name and a short tagline (e.g., “Exploring Human-Centered Design”)  
   - **About Me:** A short paragraph (2–3 sentences) about your interest in HCDD or what you’ve learned  
   - **Work Samples:** Choose two or three of the following to feature:
     - A sketch or redesign from a design activity (include image and 2-sentence description)  
     - A code sample or screenshot from a development activity  
     - Your Design Story Slide  
   - **Contact (optional):** A placeholder for email or LinkedIn (no need to use real contact info)

3. Use basic **CSS styles** to improve layout and readability:

   - Set a background color and font style  
   - Use spacing (margins, padding) to separate content  
   - Add a hover effect or border around your work samples

4. Write a short **reflection** (100–150 words) describing:
   - What you learned while building your portfolio  
   - What part of the course you’re most proud to showcase  
   - How you might grow this in a future course or project

## Submission

Submit the following:

- Your `portfolio.html` and `style.css` files  
- A screenshot if you used an online editor like CodePen  
- Your written reflection as a `.docx` or `.pdf` file
