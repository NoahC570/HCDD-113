# Development Activity: JavaScript and Simple Interaction

## Overview

In this activity, you'll build on your HTML/CSS skills by learning how JavaScript can add interactivity to a webpage. JavaScript is used by designers and developers to make websites more responsive to users—for example, reacting to clicks, changing content, or responding to user input.

## Objective

Explore the basics of JavaScript and use it to create a simple interactive element on a webpage.

## Instructions

1. Visit the [W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) and read the following sections:
   - JS Introduction  
   - JS Where To  
   - JS Output  
   - JS Statements  
   - JS Functions  

2. In the HTML file you created for the previous assignment (or a new one), add a simple JavaScript interaction. Choose **one** of the following:
   - Add a button that, when clicked, displays a message (e.g., "Thanks for visiting my page!")
   - Add a button that changes the background color of the page when clicked
   - Add a button that shows or hides one of your content sections

3. You may use the W3Schools “Try It” editor or your own text editor. Save your file and test it in a browser.

## Reflection

After completing the code, write a short reflection (100–150 words) answering:

- What did your script do?
- What part of JavaScript was hardest to understand at first?
- How could this skill help you in future HCDD courses or projects?

## Submission

Upload **one** of the following:

- Your `.html` file with embedded JavaScript
- A screenshot that shows both your code and the page output

Include your short reflection as part of the file or in a separate document.
