# Development Activity: Design Feedback in Code – Fixing a “Silent” Button

## Overview

In human-centered design, users rely on systems to provide clear feedback and visibility. When a button does something but doesn't tell the user, it creates frustration, uncertainty, and errors. In this activity, you’ll improve a small piece of code to provide better feedback and usability—applying Norman’s principles and usability heuristics directly to interaction design.

## Instructions

1. Visit the following [W3Schools “Try It” Editor](https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp).
2. Click "Run" to see what the sample button does.  
   - What happens?  
   - Does the user get clear feedback?
3. Copy the code into your own HTML file or modify it directly in the editor.
4. **Your Task:** Modify the button behavior to make the interaction clearer and more human-friendly:
   - Add text to the button that describes what it will do
   - Add visual feedback (e.g., change the color, show a message, or hide/show something)

## Reflection (Required)

Write a short reflection (100–150 words) responding to the following prompts:

- What problem did you notice in the original code (in terms of usability)?
- What did you change to improve the experience for the user?
- Which Norman principle or heuristic guided your changes? (Include a brief APA-style citation.)

## Submission

Upload **one** of the following:

- Your modified `.html` file
- A screenshot that includes both your code and the resulting output

Also include your written reflection (in plain text, Word, or PDF format).

## Learning Connection

- Understand how usability issues show up in code, not just visual design
- Practice applying Norman’s principles and feedback models in interactive behavior
- Build early confidence in modifying real front-end code
