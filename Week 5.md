# Development Activity: Mobile Applications – Physical Hardware and Information

## Overview

Mobile applications interact with physical hardware—collecting data through sensors, cameras, microphones, GPS, and more. In this activity, you'll investigate the internal components of a smartphone and connect what those components make possible to ethical concerns about user tracking, dark patterns, and forensic detection.

## Objective

- Explore the structure of mobile devices and how apps interact with system components  
- Understand what kinds of data can be captured or reconstructed through forensic tools  
- Reflect on how design decisions influence transparency and user trust

## Instructions

1. Visit the interactive [iFixit Teardown Archive](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown) or search for a teardown of a smartphone or tablet you’ve used.  
   Suggested models: iPhone, Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, etc.

2. Identify and describe at least **four components** relevant to app-based data collection or logging. Examples:
   - GPS module → location tracking  
   - Flash memory → data remnants / logs  
   - Microphone / sensors → behavioral capture  
   - Secure enclave → authentication storage  

3. Research one forensic tool (e.g., Cellebrite, Magnet AXIOM, or open-source tools like Autopsy) and describe what kind of data it can extract from mobile devices.

4. Write a **150–200 word reflection** addressing:
   - What surprised you about the hardware or data that can be recovered?  
   - How could a designer build transparency or protection into apps that use these systems?  
   - Include **one APA-style citation** from course readings to connect to HCD or ethical principles.

## Submission

Submit a document that includes:

- A short description (2–3 sentences each) of four hardware components and what they enable  
- A one-paragraph summary of the forensic tool you explored  
- Your 150–200 word reflection with at least one APA citation

## Learning Connection

- Link system-level capabilities to ethical issues in interface and application design  
- Develop awareness of what can be tracked, stored, or analyzed  
- Support informed, responsible development practices in future work
