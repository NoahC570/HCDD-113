# Development Activity: Build a Basic App Layout with Usability in Mind

## Overview

This activity helps you connect what you've learned about human-centered design principles to actual interface layout. Using HTML and CSS, you’ll build a simple app layout that demonstrates usability principles such as visibility, structure, feedback, and mapping.

## Objective

- Practice building interface structure using HTML and CSS  
- Apply usability and cognitive concepts to layout and content hierarchy  
- Explain how interface code reflects design principles

## Instructions

Choose one of the following app scenarios:

- **Option A:** A task tracker for daily to-do lists  
- **Option B:** A habit-building app with a weekly goal overview  
- **Option C:** A budgeting app with input for income and expenses  

Use **HTML and CSS** to create a basic layout with:

- A header with the app name  
- A main content area with at least two sections (e.g., task list and completed tasks)  
- A navigation area or buttons (they don’t need to work—just be placed)  
- One element that provides visual feedback (e.g., color change when hovered)  

You can code in a local HTML file or use an online editor like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io).

## Reflection (Required)

Write a short reflection (100–150 words) addressing the following:

- How did you apply one Norman principle or usability heuristic?  
- What part of the layout reflects good mapping, visibility, or user control?  
- Include one APA-style citation from *The Design of Everyday Things (DOET)* or *First Things First: Fundamental Design Usability and Cognitive Science (FDUCS)* to support your design decision.

## Submission Instructions

Submit the following:

- Your HTML and CSS code (paste into a file or link to your JSFiddle/CodePen project)  
- Your 100–150 word reflection with APA-style citation

## Learning Connection

- Link structural code decisions to user-centered design models  
- Use layout to reduce cognitive load and increase clarity  
- Practice organizing digital content with accessibility and usability in mind
