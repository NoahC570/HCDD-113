# Development Activity: Introduction to HTML & CSS Basics

## Overview

In human-centered design, we don’t just design interfaces—we often prototype them. Even if you do not become a front-end developer, understanding how HTML and CSS work helps you better collaborate with developers, structure content for users, and think critically about accessibility, layout, and interaction.

## Objective

Familiarize yourself with the core building blocks of front-end development by creating and styling a simple personal webpage.

## Instructions

1. Visit [W3Schools: HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).
2. Work through the following tutorial sections:
   - HTML Introduction  
   - HTML Editors  
   - HTML Basic  
   - HTML Elements  
   - HTML Attributes  
   - HTML Headings  
   - HTML Paragraphs  
   - HTML Styles  
   - HTML Colors  
   - HTML CSS  
   - HTML Images  
   - HTML Lists  

3. Scroll to the “HTML Examples” section and click on the “HTML Editor” tab.  
   Use “Try it Yourself” to experiment, or write your code in a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).

4. Create a simple HTML file that includes:
   - A header with your name and background color
   - An “About Me” section with a short paragraph
   - An “Interests” section using a list
   - An image using a URL that represents you or your interests
   - Styled using either a `<style>` tag or external CSS  
     _(must include two different colors and fonts)_

## Reflection (Required)

Include a short reflection (100–150 words) at the bottom of your submission or in a separate document:

- What surprised you about how structure and style work together?
- How might understanding HTML/CSS help you as a designer or HCDD student?
- Do you see ways this connects to user experience?

## Submission

Upload one of the following:
- Your `.html` file with your personal site
- A screenshot showing your code and the resulting output side-by-side

If possible, combine both code and result in a single file or image for clarity.

## Learning Connection

- Recognize the relationship between structure (HTML) and styling (CSS)
- Connect code decisions to user experience outcomes
- Practice a foundational technical skill used in prototyping, documentation, and web accessibility
